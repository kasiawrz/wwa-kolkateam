# Hipchat Help Me 

This is a project from the BrainCode 2017 hackathon.

Task: program a HipChat bot, that will help people who are responsible for answering questions on social media.

### Example:
```
User: what kind of guarantees offers you kafka?
Support: /helpme kafka-guarantees
```
then it calls the answer from the database

### Admin summary interface
I was responsible for the [Admin Interface](https://github.com/kasiawrz/wwa-kolkateam/blob/master/hip_help/templates/answers/summary.html) with summary table and graphs presenting called phrases frequency along with its likes & dislakes (if the advise was matching and helpful)
